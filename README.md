# Dungeon Eternal

A simple top-down 2D RPG game made in Unity using the <b>C# programming language</b> and <b>pixel art</b>.
This was my Bachelor's Degree diploma project, the complete documentation can be found in the repository as well.

- The player controls a knight using his keyboard (for movement and attacks) and mouse (for attacks and menu/HUD interactions). The point of the game is to exlore the map, fight hoards of enemies and get stronger in preparation for the boss fight at the end of level 1.\
- The game features a complex inventory and crafting system which can the player can interact with at any point. Each armor / weapon upgrade will increase defensive/offensive stats, like maximum health, damage or knockback power.\
- For helping the player survive, a healing system comprosed of potions (which can be crafted or received from chests) and strategically placed healing fountains which heal the player on collision exists.\
- The enemies drop experience on death, and each hoard of enemies is spawned when the player is detected nearby for increased performance.\
- The player can explore dungeons with random treasures on victory, or test his character in a special room with endless waves of enemies that increase in difficulty as time progresses.\
